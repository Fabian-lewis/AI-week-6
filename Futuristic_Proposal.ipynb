        "Climate change remains the most pressing global challenge, causing extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and biodiversity loss. Current efforts in climate mitigation are fragmented and reactive. There is a critical need for a coordinated system that can monitor, predict, and even intervene in climate dynamics proactively.\n",

        "By 2030, AI-driven global climate control could shift humanity from reactive to proactive climate management. However, its implementation would require strict ethical governance, transparency, and inclusive global cooperation to ensure its use for the collective good — not just technological elites."
